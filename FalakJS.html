	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction1()">Set background color to Green</button>
	
	

	<script>
	function myFunction1() {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green";
}

	</script>
	
	 
	<button onclick="myFunction2()">Click for Popup</button>
	
	<script>
	function myFunction2() {
    var txt;
    if (confirm("Press a button!")) {
        txt = "You pressed OK!";
    } else {
        txt = "You pressed Cancel!";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = txt;
